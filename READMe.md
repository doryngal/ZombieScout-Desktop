# ZombieScout Desktop Application - README

## Overview
The ZombieScout Desktop Application is a fully implemented solution for navigating a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. This application is designed to assist survivors in scavenging for resources while avoiding the undead. The project incorporates graph theory and pathfinding algorithms to compute the optimal routes through various terrains, including plains, deserts, mountains, facilities, and zombie-infested ruins.

## Features

### Learning Objectives Achieved
This project served as a practical exercise in working with graphs. The implementation includes:
- DFS and BFS traversal.
- Two data structures: one for a weighted graph and another for a priority queue.
- Implementation of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for finding the shortest path.

### Project Setup
The application utilizes JavaFX for the graphical user interface. Setup instructions for both Intellij and Eclipse users have been provided in the initial project documentation.

## Getting Started

### Execution
1. Ensure JavaFX is properly configured in your IDE.
2. Run the application.

### GUI
The GUI offers an intuitive interface with the following sections:
- **Menu:** Navigation and visual output modification.
- **Main Map Display:** 2D representation of the city, paths, and suggested routes.
- **Commanding Panel:** User command execution.
- **Console Panel:** Displays important messages.

### Path Finding
The core functionality of the application involves computing the best route from an infected house to a safe house, considering various terrains and obstacles. The user can simulate the path to visualize the planned route.

## Conclusion
The ZombieScout Desktop Application successfully fulfills its purpose of aiding survivors in navigating a world plagued by zombies. The implementation covers key learning objectives and provides a user-friendly experience through the graphical interface.

Feel free to explore, simulate your travel, and ensure your survival in this post-apocalyptic journey!
